ð“ŽŸð“ŽŸã€€ã€€hey! i'm john, i go by he/him primarily<br>
ã€€default to that if you aren't sure, no they/them<br>
i am mentally ill, dont ask for about disorders<br>
ã€€just know that they affect how i act very often
<br><br>

ð“ŽŸð“ŽŸã€€ã€€no huge strict byi thing. just no weirdos<br>
ã€€dont flirt or attempt to frontcall/be 'sourcemates'<br>
please block me if youre proship etc<br>
ã€€or endo-supportive
<br><br>

ð“ŽŸð“ŽŸã€€ã€€youre fine to ask for front,<br>
ã€€but sometimes i or others may not share <br>
be patient either way. most headmates have<br>
ã€€lots of trouble unmasking, and so do i <-
