ð“ŽŸð“ŽŸã€€ã€€hey! i'm john, just a little guy playin pt like you<br>
i go by he/him primarily, default to that if you aren't sure or dont wanna ask<br>
unfortunately im a mentally ill pwdid, dont ask for my disorders or about my alters<br>
just know that they affect how i act very often
<br><br>

ð“ŽŸð“ŽŸã€€ã€€i dont have a huge strict rules/byi/dni thing. just no weirdos<br>

a lot of trouble unmasking or talking, and so do i
